## Introduction

Welcome to the repository for the Social Media App, a project designed to showcase my skills in web development, particularly in using Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This application aims to emulate the core functionalities of a platform similar to Medium, providing users with a rich environment for sharing and interacting with content.

## Motivation

The primary reasons behind the development of this Social Media App include:

- **Skill Improvement:** To enhance my understanding and proficiency in web development tools and practices.
- **Showcase Learning:** To demonstrate the knowledge and skills I have acquired over the past year.
- **Engagement:** To engage in a fun and challenging project that allows me to apply my learning in a practical context.

## Goals

The Social Media App is aimed at achieving the following objectives:

- **Medium-like Experience:** To create an application that offers functionalities similar to the Medium social media platform, allowing for content creation, sharing, and interaction.
- **Future Developments:** While initially a project for learning and demonstration, there is a possibility of further development and perhaps even launching it as a fully functional platform.

## Technologies Used

This project leverages the following technologies:

- **Flask:** A micro web framework written in Python, used for handling backend operations including server setup, routing, and interaction with databases.
- **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:** Core web technologies used for structuring, styling, and adding interactivity to the web pages, ensuring a user-friendly interface and experience.
